Problem Statement :
Differently abled people find it difficult to integrate into society due to their inability to communicate through established methods.
This makes them dependent on others for many of their needs. Also, other people find it hard to communicate with them through our ideas.
We plant to address this issue by designing a pair of devices meant to foster communication.

Motivation:
People who are hearing-impaired face considerable challenges. They find difficulties to express their thoughts or to convey their message to other people so that the researchers attempt different ways in order to produce a device that may give them a better quality of the life to work in basic situations. They face lots of problems such as: 
When someone realizes they are interacting with a hearing-impaired person, they often switch to a slower form of speech. So, slowing it down intentionally can result in miscommunication.
Most of the time Job interviews are stressful situations; now consider being hearing impaired. Those who are hard of hearing or deaf may sometimes feel completely ignored when they reveal their hearing status.
Studies reveal that deaf people are around twice as likely to suffer from psychological problems such as depression and anxiety. Research suggests that this stems from feeling of isolation.

Visually impaired people face troubles due to inaccessible infrastructure and social challenges
The biggest challenge for a blind person, especially the one with the complete loss of vision, is to navigate around places
Blind people have a tough time finding good reading materials in accessible formats. The Internet is mostly inaccessible for blind people.

Our Product:

The idea is a product design of a headwear, which comprises of a camera and a Raspberry Pi module on the backend, which captures sign language and converts it into text/audio. This helps mute people who doesnâ€™t know sign language and it also helps to make the communication between differently abled people and others smoother.
